Namaste! I am Soumya Ranjan Mohanty aka SRM.

I work as a Full Stack Data Scientist at [Gramener](https://gramener.com/), India. In my day job, I work at the intersection of AI, GIS & Environment Conservation.

I have a passion for teaching & am a huge believer in free & quality education for all. On weekends, I spend my time mentoring & teaching students about Data Science at [Springboard](http://springboard.com/).

I love eating pizza & playing football!
